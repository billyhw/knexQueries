Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for about 10 minutes.Stir in diluted cornstarch. Keep the mixture at a steady simmer, stirring constantly, while mixture thickens.Stir in milk and heavy cream and bring back to a simmer. Taste then season with salt, pepper, and a bit of nutmeg. If the mixture is too thin (mine was at this point), dilute another tablespoon of cornstarch in a bit of water and stir it in, again allowing the mixture to thicken as it simmers.Remove from heat and serve immediately.

Set aside.In mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar for 2 minutes on medium. Add in dry ingredients and mix until combined. Slowly in a steady stream add in the egg white mixture. Beat in remaining milk.Fill cupcake liners half full with batter and bake in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Remove and cool in pan 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. Cool completely before frosting.For the frosting, beat butter for 5 minutes in mixing bowl until it becomes pale in color. Add sugar, vanilla and milk and beat for an additional 5 minutes until light and fluffy. Add more milk if necessary to get desired consistency.Fill pastry bag with frosting and pipe onto cooled cupcakes. I used Wilton Tip 32 and sprinkled the cupcakes immediately with white sparkling sugar. ENJOY!**cupcake recipe adapted from Sweetapolita",

Let it sit in the fridge for 2-3 hours.If you have time, remove the pork from the brining water and let it sit in the fridge for a half hour uncovered to dry out.  If time is of the essence, you can speed it up by patting the pork nice and dry with paper towel.Heat up the oil in a large sauce pan on high heat.Add the pork into the pan and let it sear for about 3-4 minutes on each side.Place it into a baking dish and slide into the oven at 300 degrees until the internal temperature reads 145 degrees.Bring it out and tent with a slice of aluminum foil for about 3-5 minutes.For the Mushroom Pan Gravy:Using the same pan you seared the pork in, cook up the onion, mushrooms and garlic on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.Drop in the flour and stir into the mixture.Deglaze the pan with the wine and then add in the chicken broth.  Let cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.Turn the heat down a notch and add in the sherry, dijon, tarragon and half & half.Salt to taste.  Serve gravy over pork.Note:  The brine ingredients were measured out for a 5 pound rack of pork.  If your rack is significantly bigger or smaller, you may want to make adjustments to how much brine you make (i.e. halve the brine recipe for a 2.5pd rack of pork.).",

Spoon out the caramelized onions and set aside in a separate bowl, leaving the melted butter behind in the pan.In a large bowl or pie pan, make the seasoned flower for dredging the chops. Whisk the arrowroot flour, remaining 1 teaspoon sea salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, and black pepper together. Place each pork chop in the flower and be sure to coat on all sides. Lay the dusted chops into the hot buttered pan and cook on high for 5 minutes each side. After both sides are cooked, remove the chops from the pan and place them the bottom of a slow cooker.To make the gravy, turn back to the saute pan now with some meat drippings, a little leftover melted butter, and some flower, add the remaining 1/4 cup of butter and stir until melted. Whisk in the remaining seasoned arrowroot flour mixture (it may start to form a paste at this point) and then whisk in the entire can of full-fat coconut milk. Slowly whisk in the entire cup of chicken or beef broth until the gravy has a smooth consistency (this may take a few turns of the whisk).Pour the gravy over the pork chops in the slow cooker, sprinkle the top with half of the caramelized onions, cover, and turn heat to medium. Cook in the slow cooker for 4-6 hours.When they're finished, carefully pull each chop out and place on a plate. Spoon extra gravy over and sprinkle the top with the remaining caramelized onions.",

(1) Leave the skin on, slice it into 3/4-inch slices so that you end up with scalloped rings. Using a spoon, scoop out seeds from the one end. Then using a paring knife cut out the seeds and uneven flesh from rings. If needed, in order to make them all fit in you baking sheet, you may slice the rings in half to form crescents.If you prefer your squash peeled, slice it in half again and slice each indented line so that you have about 1 1/2-inch pieces. Then slice each wedge one more time, ending up with about 3/4-inch slices. Using a vegetable or potato peeler, slice off the skin.Transfer slices to the prepared baking sheet and baste the tops with oil.Sprinkle with garlic powder and Parmesan cheese. Turn over and drizzle again with oil and sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese.Roast on center shelf of oven for about 25 minutes. They will brown on the bottom side. So, check them all about 15 minutes into baking. The ones that have browned to your liking, turn over. If you think they need 5 more minutes, come back then and turn them over. This prevents them from burning. The longer you bake them, the fluffier the meat of the squash becomes. If you bake them 30 minutes, they will be fluffy as mashed/whipped potatoes.",

Coat the chicken in extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill about 12 minutes, turning occasionally, then set aside.                          Bring water in saucepot to a boil for the pasta. Salt the water, add pasta and undercook by 1 minute.                          While the pasta cooks, melt 6 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepot. Spoon out 1/2 and toss with the panko to moisten. Combine with 1/2 the grated Pecorino and reserve. To the remaining melted butter, add the garlic and anchovy paste, lots of coarse black pepper, stir 2 minutes then whisk in flour then stock, milk, and Worcestershire, thicken until it coats a spoon, then stir in the remaining half of the grated Pecorino.                          Drain the pasta. Halve the chicken breasts lengthwise, then thinly slice and combine with the pasta and sauce, transfer to a casserole and top with the bread crumbs. Cool and store for make-ahead meal.                          To reheat: Reheat, covered, in a hot 425 degree F oven to warm through, then uncover to brown.                          Serve with shredded escarole or romaine and dress with lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. Serve alongside Chicken Caesar Mac.",

Add the coffee and stir to dissolve. Add the marshmallow crème and beat on low until blended and smooth. Fold in the whipped topping.Line a 9 inch round springform pan with foil and place the first layer of your angel food cake in the pan. You may have to squish it in a bit. Spread about 1/2 of the mocha mousse over the cake. Top with second layer of cake. Add remaining mocha mousse. Top with remaining layer of angel food cake. Put plastic wrap over the cake and put the whole thing in the freeze for about 3 hours or until frozen.As soon as you put the cake in the freezer, go ahead and start preparing the chocolate whipped cream since the chocolate mixture requires some chill time too.Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, milk, coffee powder and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour or up to 4.Set the stand mixer bowl back on the mixer and with the whisk attachment, beat on medium, gradually adding the cream. Continue beating, increasing speed slightly, until stiff peaks begin form — be careful not to overdo it.Remove frozen cake from freezer and unlatch sides of pan. Peel away foil and set frozen cake on a cake tray. Spread chocolate whipped cream over entire cake. You’ll have plenty of chocolate whipped cream and possible even a little left over. Store cake in the refrigerator.",

Using a wooden spoon or electric mixer, blend the eggs and oils to form a smooth emulsion (like mayonnaise), then add the soy milk, vanilla, and sugar. Add the remaining dry ingredients and continue mixing until you have a smooth, thick frangipane batter (if it's dense and dry, add a little more milk to loosen the mixture).                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Grease 6 dessert or pudding molds (about 4 inches in diameter) using a little grape seed oil. Cover the insides of the molds with the quinoa, then tip them upside down to remove any excess.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Transfer the frangipane to a pastry (piping) bag fitted with a plain tip (nozzle) and fill the molds, dividing the mixture evenly among them. Place 3 plum halves on top of the frangipane, then place the molds on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the plums look a little shriveled and the frangipane is golden and feels firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a serving plate. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.",

Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 25 minutes; drain, reserving the pot.                          Meanwhile, make the filling: Cook the bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes.Drain all but 1 tablespoon of the fat; add the beef to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 4 minutes. Add the onion, carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms, thyme and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until incorporated, about 3 minutes.                          Stir the flour into the vegetables until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook until slightly thickened, about 3 more minutes. Stir in the parsley.                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Finish the topping: Combine the butter and milk in the reserved pot and cook over medium heat until the butter is melted. Return the potatoes and turnips to the pot and mash with a potato masher or wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the parmesan and chives and season with salt and pepper.                          Transfer the filling to a 2 1/2-quart baking dish and cover with the topping, spreading evenly. Bake until the topping is golden, about 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.",

In a small heavy saucepan, heat cream and ginger until bubbles form around sides of pan. Remove from heat.                                                                                           Place flour, almonds, confectioners' sugar and cocoa in a food processor; pulse until blended. Add cold butter; pulse until butter is the size of peas. While pulsing, add 1/4 cup amaretto to form moist crumbs. Press onto bottom and up sides of an ungreased 9-in. fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Bake 13-16 minutes or until set. Cool on a wire rack.                                                                                           Place chocolate in a small bowl. Bring gingered cream just to a boil. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer over chocolate; discard ginger. Stir chocolate mixture with a whisk until smooth; stir in softened butter and remaining amaretto until blended. Pour into cooled crust. Refrigerate, covered, at least 2 hours or until set.

            "instructions": "For the pesto: Combine the basil and garlic in a food processor and mix while slowly adding the olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Continue this process until all the basil has been used. Reserve 1/4 cup of the pesto to mix into the rice. Transfer the remaining pesto to a bowl and mix with the shredded cheeses. Cover with plastic wrap and set in refrigerator.                          For the rice: In a medium saucepot over high heat, add the beef stock, butter and salt. When the stock reaches a boil, add the rice and stir it a bit to prevent sticking. Let it come to a rolling boil and lower the heat a bit to medium. Stir the rice once in a while, you want the rice to absorb all of the liquid; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be slightly al dente but creamy. Remove the pot from the heat, add the cheeses and add the 1/4 cup reserved pesto to the rice and stir thoroughly. Pour the rice onto a baking sheet and spread into a thin layer. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool, preferably overnight in the fridge.                          For the filling and assembly: Portion out the cooled rice into identical portions. We weigh ours to 1.6 ounces. Take one portion and form it into a semi-circle in the palm of your hand, making a cup-like shape to place the pesto and cherry tomato. Scoop about 1 tablespoons of the pesto-cheese mixture into the half ball and then 2 tomato halves. Take another portion of rice and flatten it into a disk shape. Place that disk over the half ball to enclose the pesto and tomatoes in the center. Have a bowl of warm water nearby to dip your hands into; it'll make the process easier and less sticky. Roll the ball around to enclose all the ingredients in the center and shape into a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.                          For the batter and breading: Place the flour and 1 1/2 cups cold water into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk until smooth and about the consistency of eggnog. Place the breadcrumbs in a large bowl or baking dish. Roll each ball in batter and shake off excess batter. Then roll each ball in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the balls.                          Use a heavy duty pot with enough canola oil to submerge the balls in. Make sure the oil isn't near the top of the pot because it will overflow when you drop your balls in. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F, using a high temp thermometer if you have one. If not you can throw a small piece of white bread in to test; it should brown quickly and float when the oil is hot enough.                          Use a slotted spoon or wire basket to lower your balls into the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the balls - maybe 2 or 3 at a time. Fry in batches until they are golden like arancini (\"little oranges\"), about 5 minutes. Remove and place on paper towels to drain. Eat hot.",

Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl and stir with a fork to mix well. Stir the vanilla into the milk and set aside.3. In a large bowl, beat the butter with a mixer at high speed until light and fluffy. Add the brown sugar in 3 additions, mixing well after each, and then add the granulated sugar all at once, beating well after each addition. Add the eggs, 1 t a time, beating well after each addition. Add half the flour and then half the milk, beating at low speed just until the flour or milk disappears into the batter. Add the rest of the flour and then the remaining milk in the same way.4. Quickly scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake at 325°F (160°C) for 1 hour and 10 minutes (55 to 60 minutes for loaf pans), or until the cake is nicely browned at the edges, springs back when touched lightly at the center, and a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.5. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack or a folded kitchen towel for 20 to 30 minutes. Loosen the cake from the pan with a table knife and turn it out onto a wire rack or a plate, top side up, to cool completely, top side up.Make the caramel glaze (optional)6. Combine the butter and brown sugar in a medium saucepan. Stir over medium heat until the butter melts and blends with the brown sugar to make a smooth sauce, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the milk, and let the icing come to a gentle boil.7. Stir well, remove from the heat, and add the sifted confectioners’ sugar and the vanilla. Beat well with a mixer, whisk, or spoon for 1 or 2 minutes, until the glaze thickens and loses a little of its shine.8. Use at once. If the glaze hardens, stir in 1 or 2 spoonfuls of evaporated milk to soften it.",

Measure 1 cup mint leaves and 2 cups of parsley leaves and chop. I chop them together to save time.   Finally, rinse quinoa and measure spices for quinoa and spices for salad.Heat a saucepan over medium high heat. Add 2 teaspoons olive oil. When hot, add quinoa, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, ¼ teaspoon ground cumin and a pinch crushed red pepper flakes. Toast for 2 minutes. Add water and bring to a boil. Cover, lower light to medium and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.In a large glass bowl, combine quinoa with vegetables, herbs, spices, lemon juice and olive oil. Toss to combine, cover and refrigerate. The longer this sits the better it is so if you can make it a day ahead of when you plan on serving it or at least a couple of hours. Excellent with hummus and pita bread or over lettuce. Enjoy!",

Line the bottom and sides of an 9X13-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or foil, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides. Lightly grease with cooking spray and set aside.Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in a medium microwave-wafe bowl (you can do this on the stovetop also). Microwave for one minute intervals, stirring in between, until the butter is melted and the mixture is smooth. Set the mixture aside until it cools slightly (is warm to the touch not hot). It will look gritty but it will become smooth once the other ingredients are added.Stir in the vanilla with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Add the eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one. When the batter looks thick, shiny, and well blended, add the flour and stir until you cannot see it any longer, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with the wooden spoon or a rubber spatula. Spread evenly in the lined pan.Melt the peanut butter in a small bowl on low heat in the microwave until pourable, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Drizzle the peanut butter over the brownies and lightly swirl with a butter knife. It's alright if you don't get awesome drizzle action going on; the peanut butter in my brownies formed almost a separate layer and it was fantastic. Sprinkle the pretzels, chocolate chips and toffee over the top. Bake the brownies for about 22-25 minutes until set but still slightly sticky in the center when a toothpick is inserted. Let cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.",

Drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to stop the cooking process. When cool enough to handle, carefully peel the cooked eggs; season with salt and pepper. Rinse and dry the pot.2Prepare the ingredients: While the eggs cook, wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a second medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Cut off and discard the bottom inch of the broccolini stalks; halve the stalks crosswise. Peel and small dice the onion. Crumble the goat cheese. Peel and mince the garlic.3Blanch the broccolini:Add the broccolini to the second pot of boiling water and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the stalks are tender when pierced with a knife. Drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Rinse and dry the pot.4Make the onion jam:While the broccolini cooks, in the pot used to cook the eggs, combine the onion and  cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until the water has evaporated. Add the honey and vinegar. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a bowl. Carefully rinse and dry the pot.5Cook the polenta:While the onion jam cooks, in the pot used to cook the broccolini, combine 3 cups of water and a big pinch of salt. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, slowly add the polenta, whisking to break up any clumps. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, whisking occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes, or until thickened and tender. (If the polenta seems too thick, add up to  cup of water to achieve your desired consistency.) Remove from heat and whisk in the goat cheese until thoroughly combined; season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside in a warm place.6Finish the broccolini & plate your dish:In the pot used to make the onion jam, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the garlic and as much of the red pepper flakes as youd like, depending on how spicy youd like the dish to be. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the blanched broccolini and almonds; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until warmed through; season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the cooked polenta between 2 dishes. Top with the finished broccolini, onion jam and peeled eggs. Enjoy!1Cook & peel the eggs:Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high.

The mixture should stick together when pressed between two fingers.Press the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan and set in the freezer while you make the filling.In a high-speed blender, blend the avocados, mint leaves, agave and mint extract until smooth. You may need to stop and scrap down the sides a few times.Add the coconut oil and blend for a few seconds to combine. The mixture should be thick and creamy. (If your blender doesn't move the mixture very well, try blending it in batches until smooth.)Remove the pan from the freezer and pour the mixture on top of the crust, smoothing it out with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Return to the freezer until firm, at least one hour.Whisk together all ingredients until smooth. You may need to warm up the mixture if the cacao butter firms up too quickly. You can do this by using a double boiler a very low heat setting to keep it warm while whisking, or by putting the mixture in the dehydrator for a few minutes.Remove the pan from the freezer again and pour the chocolate topping on top of the avocado filling, smoothing it out quickly with an offset spatula or the back of a spoon. Return to the freezer one last time until the topping is set.It takes some practice to cut any kind of Nanaimo bars without cracking the chocolate topping, and the same goes for raw Nanaimo bars. For best results, remove the bar from the pan by pulling up on the parchement paper and set on a cutting board. Place a sharp serrated knife in a jar of hot water for several minutes, wipe it on a kitchen towel and then use light sawing motions with the knife to cut into squares. Warm the knife in the water as needed to cut all squares. Store bars in an air-tight container in the freezer.",

Whip together pumpkin, cream cheese, spice and sugar in food processor or mixer until smooth.3. Line muffin pan with paper candy cups. Take a large spoon, and spoon some chocolate into the paper candy cup. Using the back of the spoon, spread the chocolate so that it coats the entire interior of the candy cup. Make sure the layer of chocolate is thick enough that it does not drip off and leave parts of the side uncovered. Repeat with remaining cups.4. Take another clean spoon and scoop out some pumpkin cheesecake into each of the cups. Press on it gently so that it fills and packs the bottom of each cup about halfway and is spread across the entire cup. Then taking the chocolate spoon, top chocolate on each cup, so that it completely covers the surface. Use back of spoon to help smooth out surface.5.

In a food processor, mix together squash puree, heavy cream, brown sugar mixture, salt, egg yolks and maple syrup. Once smooth, strain with wire sieve into sauce pot.Cook squash mixture over medium heat, whisking frequently, mixture should bubble and thicken. Turn burner to low, and continue cooking for another minute or two. You will strain mixture again in wire sieve.

Cool.Pour pudding into pie crust, and chill. Serve with maple syrup and chopped pecans! AND of course some whipped cream silly!",

(Do not butter the pan or the paper, that’s a definite no-no.)2. Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over but not touching gently simmering water. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the butter until it’s melted. Set aside.3. In another bowl, whisk the 2 whole eggs and the 4 egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the sugar just until blended. Slowly whisk in the warm chocolate mixture. Whisk in the cognac or Grand Marnier and the orange zest, if using. In another bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the 4 egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until the whites form soft peaks that hold their shape but aren’t quite stiff. Gently, gently fold about 1/4 of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the remaining whites. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top.4. Bake the cake until the top is puffed and cracked and the center is no longer wobbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Be careful not to overbake the cake.5. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack. The center of the cake will sink as it cools, forming a sort of crater.Put the finishing touches on the cake6. When ready to serve, whip the cream with the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until not quite stiff. Using a spatula, carefully fill the sunken center of the cake with the whipped cream, pushing the billowy cream gently all the way to the edges of the cake in decorative swoops and swirls. Sprinkle the top lightly with cocoa powder. Run the tip of a knife around the edge of the cake, carefully remove the side of the pan, and serve.",

Add 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil to the hot pan and sear the chicken pieces until golden brown, about 5 minutes each side. Transfer to another plate and finish searing the rest of the chicken pieces, then transfer to the same plate as the rest of the chicken. Add the rest of the olive oil to the pan and the minced garlic, and cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant, stirring so the garlic doesn't burn and become bitter. Add the green olives, capers and broth. Add the reserved chicken and any juices that have been released plus the reserved lemons and their juices and cook over high heat until the broth is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add the butter and parsley and cook for another minute. Season with more kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Transfer to plates and spoon the olives, capers, lemons and sauce on top. Serve with sautéed spinach, kale or swiss chard on the side.",

Add the potatoes and cauliflower to a large pot and cover with cold water. Season with a big pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and cauliflower in a colander.                          Add the chopped leek to a small bowl and cover with water. Let sit and soak for a few minutes to remove all the grit. Drain well and pat dry with paper towels.                          Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the leeks and saute until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add the kale and saute until wilted down and softened, about 5 minutes longer. Add the milk to the skillet and bring up to a simmer. Stir in the drained potatoes and cauliflower and mash all together. Stir in the sour cream and Parmesan for some extra flavor. Taste and adjust the flavor as needed. Add the whole shebang to a 2-quart baking dish and dot with the butter. Bake until golden brown on top, about 35 minutes.",

Stir until butter melts and mixture is fairly smooth and the sugar has partially dissolved -- mixture will still be slightly grainy. Remove from heat and let it cool to warm.Stir in the vanilla, then add the eggs one at a time and stir after each egg is added.Add the flour and stir until it disappears, then beat vigorously for 40 strokes with a heavy duty scraper.Spread mixture evenly in the pan and bake at 325 for about 25 minutes or until brownies appear set. Let cool completely, then chill thoroughly.Time for the fun part! Lift the brownies from the pan and cut into shapes using metal cookie cutters or whatever type cutter you have.Melt chocolate in microwave using 50% power and stirring often until it is melted and smooth. Spread a very thin layer of chocolate on top of each brownie, then pile on some M&Ms. Drizzle more chocolate over M&Ms. Let the brownies sit until chocolate sets. Do not chill after adding M&Ms as they will lose their luster.",

I didn’t so I had to settle for bottled vanilla essence.Start by scalding the cream and the vanilla essence. “Scalding” means gently heating, over low heat, and without allowing to reach boiling point.While the cream scalds, add the white sugar to the egg yolks.Mix together the egg yolks and sugar until the sugar is fully dissolved. DO NOT BEAT.Take about half a cup of the heated cream and pour into the egg-sugar mixture. Mix. You are tempering the egg yolks at this point so that they do not cook and curdle. When the mixture is smooth, pour in the rest of the cream. MIX WITHOUT BEATING so that bubbles do not form. Bubbles are the most serious nemesis of custard and you really want to keep them away.Pour the mixture into ramekins. Dot the surface with a tissue to get rid of bubbles formed while pouring.Place the ramekins in baking dishes and pour boiling water into the baking dishes halfway up the height of the ramekins. Be careful not to let any water drip into the ramekins.Bake the custards for 30 to 35 minutes. Immediately remove from the water bath and cool for about 10 minutes before putting in the fridge. Chill for at least three hours.Spinkle the brown sugar over the cold custards. Level off with the back of a spoon.Turn on your kitchen torch and start melting the sugar.Use circular motions, going slow and watching the sugar as it melts and caramelizes.It’s an amazing process, really, seeing the sugar turn to the color of amber then getting darker. The tiny brown spots grow bigger and darker as you keeping spraying the surface of the custard with heat. It’s fun torching the sugar, that’s why Speedy and Sam took turns doing it, but remember that there is a thin, thin line between perfectly caramelized sugar and burnt sugar, and burst sugar tastes terribly bitter. So don’t have too much fun with the kitchen torch.As soon as one custard is done, move to the next.And repeat the process…Going ’round and ’round until the topping is nicely covered with brown spots.And there you have it.

Carefully and slowly add the heavy cream, stirring with a whisk, then add the butter, vanilla and salt. Bring back to a boil and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Cool the caramel for 10 minutes, then add the orange oil and food coloring. Cool completely before using.                          For the gummy tails: In a small liquid measuring cup, bloom the gelatin in 1/2 cup cold water for 5 minutes. Warm the mixture in a microwave on high until the mixture is liquid and smooth, 15 seconds. Add the orange oil, mixing it in well.                          For the shells: Temper the chocolate. Fill the mouse molds with the chocolate and knock them carefully on a hard surface to release any air bubbles. Pour out the excess chocolate back into the bowl of tempered chocolate.                          Scrape the flat portion of the mold to clean off the excess chocolate. Cool the mouse shells to harden completely.                          Place the cold caramel in a piping bag, with a small hole cut in the end. Pack the pumpkin seeds into the body cavities of the chocolate shells, then pipe in the caramel until the filling is 1/16-inch below the top. Pour more tempered chocolate over the filling, and scrape the excess again, then let cool and set up completely. Carefully dig out any chocolate that may have gotten into the tail portion of each mouse mold. Clean them with cheese cloth until shiny. Pour the liquid gelatin mixture into the tail portion of each mouse mold. Let cool and set up completely. Release the mice from their molds by gently tapping the mold, right-side up, until they all come out. If any of the gelatin tails do not adhere to their chocolate bodies, use a small amount of tempered chocolate to glue them back on.",

Mash down with a fork and continue stirring and mashing while the mixture heats up. The dates should soften after about 3-5 minutes. Continue mashing and stirring until paste becomes smoother and uniform. It is okay to see some chunks still - as long as it is a uniform paste then it is ready to use.Make the granola barsOnce the date paste is smooth and softened, add peanut butter and coconut oil to the pot. Stir constantly to combine and remove from heat once the mixture is smooth and the coconut oil has melted (about 1 minute). Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract.Pour in the oat flour, shredded coconut, ground cinnamon and salt (if using) and mix in gently.Toss in the rolled oats and flaxseeds and combine gently with a spatula or large spoon. Fold in the sunflower seeds and half of the almonds and cranberries.Pour granola mixture into prepared pan.Spread evenly and press down firmly using a flat spatula. Sprinkle remaining almonds and dried cranberries evenly. Press down firmly again with spatula or your hands to flatten and bind together. Chill in the freezer for 1 hour or refrigerator for 3 hours or overnight to set.Remove from the freezer or fridge and use the foil overhang to transfer the uncut bars to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, cut into even rectangles.Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If you have to stack them, be sure to use parchment paper or foil in between the layers, otherwise they'll stick together. Bars are best enjoyed straight out of the fridge since they tend to soften up at room temperature.",

Toss to evenly coat the sweet potatoes with oil and spices. Spread sweet potato cubes evenly around pan and roast for 35-45 minutes, stirring halfway through, until sweet potatoes are fork tender. While the sweet potatoes are cooking, chop your kale if you havent already and add it to a large bowl. Next prepare your dressing: In a small bowl add the following: olive oil, orange juice, apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard and maple syrup; whisk until smooth. Pour dressing all over the chopped kale and use your (clean) hands to gently massage the dressing into the kale for a few minutes. This helps remove any bitterness from the kale and adds flavor the the leafy green. Once sweet potato cubes are done cooking, add it to the kale. Pour into 4 salad bowls, or 1 large bowl for sharing. Before you serve the salad, top with pumpkin seeds, feta and roasted crunchy chickpeas. (Tip: Dont add the cheese or pumpkin seeds until you are ready to eat; you want them crunchy not soggy.)",

Add the butter on top of the apple mixture. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Take the bowl out and stir. Microwave for another minute. The mixture should resemble apple pie filling now; if it's not cooked enough, put it back in the microwave for another 30 seconds.Take each wonton wrapper and put a spoonful of apple pie filling on one side, dip your finger in water and wet two edges of the wonton wrapper.Fold over half of the wrapper to make a triangle shape.Press the edges together to seal them. Repeat until all the wrappers are done. Don't fret if some of the wrappers get small tears in them as you're making these ... the filling is thick enough that it really won't matter.Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and arrange the wontons on the baking sheet, leaving a little space in between the wontons. Spray the wontons with cooking spray and (if desired), sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar.Bake at 350 for about 8 -10 minutes or until the wontons are nicely brown and crisp on the outside.

Be sure to stir often during this process it will improve the texture of the ganache. Bring to room temperature before using.Make the dough: In a large bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl stir together butter, brown sugar, and egg. Add flour mixture to butter mixture, and stir to combine. Knead until a dough forms. Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.Make the cookies: When ready to form cookies roll out each half of dough between 2 sheets of lightly floured parchment to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to baking sheets, and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 350 degrees with racks in upper and lower thirds. using a cookie cutter that’s about 2-inches wide (choose an uncomplicated shape such as round, square, heart or star), making sure you have even numbers in each for a total of about twenty-four 2-inch cookies, re-rolling and re-chilling scraps as needed. Place cookies 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, and freeze until very firm, about 15 minutes.Bake until firm and fragrant, about 10 to 12 minutes, rotating halfway through. Let cookies cool completely on baking sheets set on wire racks. Spread or pipe (using a pastry bag and a small plain tip) the ganache filling onto bottom side of half the cookies, and sandwich with remaining cookies, pressing gently. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.Make the optional topping: Melt the remaining 3 ounces of white chocolate in a small heat proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Once melted drizzle or pipe (using a pastry bag and a small plain tip) the white chocolate in an attractive pattern over the tops of the cookies.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading...",

Place the orange rinds in the slow cooker as well to add flavor. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or high for 4-5 hours until pork is tender.When pork is done remove from slow cooker and remove the onions, oranges, garlic and jalapenos, so all you have remaining is liquid.

You can also do this step up to a few days ahead.Preheat oven to 375*Butter a 9x13 baking dish and set aside.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook Rotini according to package directions.Meanwhile while pasta is cooking in a large skillet melt 6 Tbsp butter over medium heat. Once butter is melted whisk in your flour creating a pasta and cook for 1 more minute. Slowly add warmed milk to butter and milk, whisking constantly. Add cayenne pepper.

Immediately remove from heat and stir in the mint leaves. Cover and let stand for 1 hour to allow the flavours to infuse.Pour the infused cream through a fine mesh strainer to remove the mint, pressing firmly on the leaves to extract as much flavour as possible.Stir in the sugar and salt, and return the infused cream to the stovetop over medium-high heat. Warm the cream until wisps of steam start to rise from the surface.In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, then slowly pour some of the warm mint mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan.Cook the custard, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Immediately remove from heat, and stir in the remaining 1 cup cream along with the creme de menthe and food colouring, if using.Scrape the custard into a clean mixing bowl, and cover with plastic wrap, placing the wrap directly on the surface of the custard to stop a skin from forming. Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.While the custard base is chilling, melt the chocolate in the microwave or a double boiler until smooth. Add the oil, and set aside to cool to room temperature.Using an ice cream maker, freeze the chilled custard as per the manufacturer’s directions.To create the chocolate “chips”, spoon a layer of ice cream into the container, then drizzle a thin stream of chocolate overtop using a swirling motion. Continue alternating layers of ice cream and chocolate until both of them are done, then swirl the mixture with a butter knife to break up the chocolate into irregular pieces. Cover and transfer to the freezer to chill until firm and scoopable, about 3-4 hours.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the oil, egg, half-and-half, lemon juice and zest, the 1 cup (8 ounces) sugar, and the almond extract. Whisk to blend thoroughly. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until just combined.3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Arrange the plum halves, cut side up, on top of the batter. In a bowl, combine the almonds, the 2 tablespoons sugar, and the butter and mix well. Dot the almond topping over the cake.4. Bake the cake until the topping is golden brown and a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. (If using an 8-inch pan, you may need to bake it longer, being careful to cover the outer edges of the cake with a strip of foil if they begin to brown.) Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes. Remove the ring from the pan and place the cake on a serving platter. Cut into wedges and serve warm or, if you can wait, at room temperature.",

Set aside.Pop open crescent roll dough and unroll, leaving crescents in rectangles. On an ungreased baking sheet, lay the crescent roll rectangles together, lining them up width wise. Dough should be almost the entire length of a half sheet pan.Press edges together to even out edges and seal any holes. Cut 1/2 inch diagonal strips up each side of the dough. Carefully spread cream cheese filling down the center of the dough to be about 2-3 inches wide. Top with cooked apples.Fold 1/2 inch dough pieces up over filling alternating sides to get a braided pattern. You may have excess dough once you reach the end of the danish, so fold them in as best as you can. Bake for 20 minutes or until filling is set and crescent dough is golden in color. Cool at least 20 minutes before removing from baking sheet.Once danish has cooled, remove to serving platter. In a small bowl, mix together powdered sugar, vanilla and cream to create icing. You may need to add more cream to get the desired consistency. Drizzle icing over danish.Cut into pieces and serve.",

Place directly on the oven rack and bake until the skin is crisp, about 10 minutes.                          Meanwhile, chop the bell pepper and scallions. Cook the bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, then chop. Add the bell pepper and all but 1 tablespoon of the scallions to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 4 minutes. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook until wilted, 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl; reserve the skillet.                          Split the potatoes and scoop out half of the flesh from each; stir into the vegetables along with the cheese, broth, hot sauce and all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon back into the potatoes. Set on a baking sheet and bake 5 minutes.                          Return the skillet to medium-high heat; crack the eggs into the pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the whites are set, 5 minutes. Serve the eggs over the potatoes; top with the reserved scallions and bacon. Serve with more hot sauce.

            "instructions": "Make the sponge cake crust1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.2. In a small bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.3. Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until thick, light yellow ribbons form, about 5 minutes more. Beat in the extracts.4. Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand, just until no more white flecks appear. Now, blend in the melted butter.5. Now, wash the mixing bowl and beaters really well (if even a little fat is left, this can cause the egg whites not to whip). Put the egg whites and cream of tartar into the bowl and beat with the mixer on high until frothy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form (the whites will stand up and look glossy, not dry). Fold about one-third of the whites into the batter, then the remaining whites. Don’t worry if you still see a few white specks, as they’ll disappear during baking.6. Gently spread out the batter over the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it’s done. Watch carefully and don’t let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the cheesecake batter.Make the cheesecake7. Dissolve the instant espresso in the hot water in a small cup and let stand. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl down several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each one. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar, then the vanilla.8. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each one. Stir the dissolved coffee into the cream, then beat into the cream cheese mixture just until completely blended. Be careful not to overmix! Gently spoon the batter on top of the cooled sponge cake crust.9. Place the cake in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the springform. Bake until the edges are light golden brown and the top is light tan, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and let the cake cool for 2 hours (just walk away — don’t move it). Leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely cold, preferably overnight or at least 4 hours.10. To decorate, release and remove the sides of the springform, leaving the cake on the bottom of the pan. Place on a cake plate. Cover the top with chocolate curls and dust with cocoa. Decorate the center of the cake with a few coffee beans if you wish (be sure to remove them before serving). Refrigerate until ready to serve. Slice the cold cake with a sharp straight-edge knife, not a serrated one. Cover any leftover cake and refrigerate, or wrap and freeze for up to one month.",

Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.2. In a small bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.3. Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until thick, light yellow ribbons form, about 5 minutes more. Beat in the extracts.4. Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand, just until no more white flecks appear. Now, blend in the melted butter.5. Now, wash the mixing bowl and beaters really well (if even a little fat is left, this can cause the egg whites not to whip).",

Gently spread out the batter over the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it’s done. Watch carefully and don’t let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the cheesecake batter.Make the cheesecake7. Dissolve the instant espresso in the hot water in a small cup and let stand. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl down several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each one. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar, then the vanilla.8. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each one. Stir the dissolved coffee into the cream, then beat into the cream cheese mixture just until completely blended.

You may have to use your fingers to press it all together.Divide the dough in half and press it across the bottom and halfway up the sides of the 2 mini cheesecake pans. Gently prick the dough across the bottom of the pan with a fork several times. Bake for only 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.Reduce the oven temperature to 350.In a large bowl beat the cream cheese and sugar until fluffy and smooth.Add the egg and beat for about 1½ minutes. Add the vanilla, cream, and bourbon. Beat until combined. Divide the batter evenly between the two par-baked crusts.Bake at 350 for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 275 (I like to open the oven door for just a minute to help the temperature drop) and bake for 15 more minutes. Turn the oven off and let the cheesecakes cool IN the oven.When they have cooled to room temperature, remove and refrigerate. (Sometimes I am in a hurry so I take mine out when it is cool enough to grab by hand -- the pans will still feel warm) The cheesecakes will need to chill for at least an hour (from room temperature).While the cheesecakes chill, and just before you are ready to serve,heat the hot fudge in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When it is smooth and warm (a pourable consistency), stir in the bourbon. Drizzle the chocolate over each cheesecake and serve.",

Salt the water and cook the pasta shy of al dente, 5 to 6 minutes.                          While the water comes to a boil, heat the EVOO in a Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and remove some of the drippings, leaving a thin layer. Add the beef, brown and crumble, but leave a few larger pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Once the beef has caramelized, add the onions and cook to tender. Add the stock and Worcestershire, then reduce the heat to low.                          In a saucepot over medium to medium-high heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour, cook 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and season with salt and pepper. Thicken to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the cheese. When the cheese has melted into the sauce, stir in the mustard, ketchup, relish and hot sauce. Combine the pasta with the sauce and fold in the meat. Place in a large casserole dish. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal.                          To serve, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring the casserole to room temp then bake until brown and bubbly on top and golden at edges, 45 to 50 minutes.",

Pour the liquid yogurt panna cotta into 4 - 6 oz. ramekins or short wide mugs.Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours.Once the panna cotta sets, combine the blackberries, water, 3/4 tsp. gelatin, maple syrup, pinch of salt and orange zest in a small sauce pan. Bring to a boil, lower the temperature, and simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken.Allow the blackberry gel to cool for 10 minutes. Then spoons evenly over the tops of the yogurt panna cotta cups.Return to the fridge and chill another two hours minimum.Serve as is, or remove from molds.To remove the panna cotta from the molds: Run a sharp knife around the rim of each cup. Fill a small bowl with hot water. Then hold each cup in the water for approximately 30 seconds. Place a dessert plate over the top and flip. You may have to wait a few moments for the panna cotta to release, plopping gently on the plate. Repeat with the rest.",

Remove garlic and shallots and set aside.4. Raise heat to high and add the steaks, making sure they are at least once inch apart.  Cook them without moving them for 4 minutes.  Turn them with tongs and cook another 4 minutes.  (This will cook them medium rare - adjust the cooking time if you like them more well done, or if your steaks are thicker than 2 inches).5. Remove the steaks, spread them with herb butter and let them sit for 5 minutes.  Then serve with the browned garlic and shallots scattered around them.",
