Once boiling, carefully add the eggs and cook for exactly 6 minutes. Drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to stop the cooking process. When cool enough to handle, carefully peel the cooked eggs; season with salt and pepper. Rinse and dry the pot.2Prepare the ingredients: While the eggs cook, wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a second medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Cut off and discard the bottom inch of the broccolini stalks; halve the stalks crosswise. Peel and small dice the onion. Crumble the goat cheese. Peel and mince the garlic.3Blanch the broccolini:Add the broccolini to the second pot of boiling water and cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until the stalks are tender when pierced with a knife. Drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Rinse and dry the pot.4Make the onion jam:While the broccolini cooks, in the pot used to cook the eggs, combine the onion and  cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cook, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes, or until the water has evaporated. Add the honey and vinegar. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 4 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened; season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a bowl. Carefully rinse and dry the pot.5Cook the polenta:While the onion jam cooks, in the pot used to cook the broccolini, combine 3 cups of water and a big pinch of salt. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, slowly add the polenta, whisking to break up any clumps. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, whisking occasionally, 10 to 12 minutes, or until thickened and tender. (If the polenta seems too thick, add up to  cup of water to achieve your desired consistency.) Remove from heat and whisk in the goat cheese until thoroughly combined; season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside in a warm place.6Finish the broccolini & plate your dish:In the pot used to make the onion jam, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the garlic and as much of the red pepper flakes as youd like, depending on how spicy youd like the dish to be. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the blanched broccolini and almonds; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until warmed through; season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the cooked polenta between 2 dishes. Top with the finished broccolini, onion jam and peeled eggs. Enjoy!1Cook & peel the eggs:Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high.

Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over but not touching gently simmering water. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk in the butter until it’s melted. Set aside.3. In another bowl, whisk the 2 whole eggs and the 4 egg yolks with 1/2 cup of the sugar just until blended. Slowly whisk in the warm chocolate mixture. Whisk in the cognac or Grand Marnier and the orange zest, if using. In another bowl, with an electric mixer, beat the 4 egg whites until foamy. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until the whites form soft peaks that hold their shape but aren’t quite stiff. Gently, gently fold about 1/4 of the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then gently fold in the remaining whites. Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top.4. Bake the cake until the top is puffed and cracked and the center is no longer wobbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Be careful not to overbake the cake.5. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack. The center of the cake will sink as it cools, forming a sort of crater.Put the finishing touches on the cake6. When ready to serve, whip the cream with the confectioners’ sugar and vanilla until not quite stiff. Using a spatula, carefully fill the sunken center of the cake with the whipped cream, pushing the billowy cream gently all the way to the edges of the cake in decorative swoops and swirls. Sprinkle the top lightly with cocoa powder. Run the tip of a knife around the edge of the cake, carefully remove the side of the pan, and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the cake1.

I didn’t so I had to settle for bottled vanilla essence.Start by scalding the cream and the vanilla essence. “Scalding” means gently heating, over low heat, and without allowing to reach boiling point.While the cream scalds, add the white sugar to the egg yolks.Mix together the egg yolks and sugar until the sugar is fully dissolved. DO NOT BEAT.Take about half a cup of the heated cream and pour into the egg-sugar mixture. Mix. You are tempering the egg yolks at this point so that they do not cook and curdle. When the mixture is smooth, pour in the rest of the cream. MIX WITHOUT BEATING so that bubbles do not form. Bubbles are the most serious nemesis of custard and you really want to keep them away.Pour the mixture into ramekins. Dot the surface with a tissue to get rid of bubbles formed while pouring.Place the ramekins in baking dishes and pour boiling water into the baking dishes halfway up the height of the ramekins. Be careful not to let any water drip into the ramekins.Bake the custards for 30 to 35 minutes. Immediately remove from the water bath and cool for about 10 minutes before putting in the fridge. Chill for at least three hours.Spinkle the brown sugar over the cold custards. Level off with the back of a spoon.Turn on your kitchen torch and start melting the sugar.Use circular motions, going slow and watching the sugar as it melts and caramelizes.It’s an amazing process, really, seeing the sugar turn to the color of amber then getting darker. The tiny brown spots grow bigger and darker as you keeping spraying the surface of the custard with heat. It’s fun torching the sugar, that’s why Speedy and Sam took turns doing it, but remember that there is a thin, thin line between perfectly caramelized sugar and burnt sugar, and burst sugar tastes terribly bitter. So don’t have too much fun with the kitchen torch.As soon as one custard is done, move to the next.And repeat the process…Going ’round and ’round until the topping is nicely covered with brown spots.And there you have it. Creme brulee. Ready for your dessert spoon.We ate the custard off the ramekins. Directly. Right there in the kitchen. Then we went back to finish our Scrabble game. Which Sam won.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat the oven to 325oF.If you have access to dried or fresh vanilla bean, use it.

It’s fun torching the sugar, that’s why Speedy and Sam took turns doing it, but remember that there is a thin, thin line between perfectly caramelized sugar and burnt sugar, and burst sugar tastes terribly bitter.
