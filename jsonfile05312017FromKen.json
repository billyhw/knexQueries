Reduce heat to medium low and simmer for about 10 minutes.Stir in diluted cornstarch. Keep the mixture at a steady simmer, stirring constantly, while mixture thickens.Stir in milk and heavy cream and bring back to a simmer. Taste then season with salt, pepper, and a bit of nutmeg. If the mixture is too thin (mine was at this point), dilute another tablespoon of cornstarch in a bit of water and stir it in, again allowing the mixture to thicken as it simmers.Remove from heat and serve immediately.

Set aside.In mixing bowl, beat butter and sugar for 2 minutes on medium. Add in dry ingredients and mix until combined. Slowly in a steady stream add in the egg white mixture. Beat in remaining milk.Fill cupcake liners half full with batter and bake in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Remove and cool in pan 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack. Cool completely before frosting.For the frosting, beat butter for 5 minutes in mixing bowl until it becomes pale in color. Add sugar, vanilla and milk and beat for an additional 5 minutes until light and fluffy. Add more milk if necessary to get desired consistency.Fill pastry bag with frosting and pipe onto cooled cupcakes. I used Wilton Tip 32 and sprinkled the cupcakes immediately with white sparkling sugar. ENJOY!**cupcake recipe adapted from Sweetapolita",

Let it sit in the fridge for 2-3 hours.If you have time, remove the pork from the brining water and let it sit in the fridge for a half hour uncovered to dry out.  If time is of the essence, you can speed it up by patting the pork nice and dry with paper towel.Heat up the oil in a large sauce pan on high heat.Add the pork into the pan and let it sear for about 3-4 minutes on each side.Place it into a baking dish and slide into the oven at 300 degrees until the internal temperature reads 145 degrees.Bring it out and tent with a slice of aluminum foil for about 3-5 minutes.For the Mushroom Pan Gravy:Using the same pan you seared the pork in, cook up the onion, mushrooms and garlic on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.Drop in the flour and stir into the mixture.Deglaze the pan with the wine and then add in the chicken broth.  Let cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.Turn the heat down a notch and add in the sherry, dijon, tarragon and half & half.Salt to taste.  Serve gravy over pork.Note:  The brine ingredients were measured out for a 5 pound rack of pork.  If your rack is significantly bigger or smaller, you may want to make adjustments to how much brine you make (i.e. halve the brine recipe for a 2.5pd rack of pork.).",

Spoon out the caramelized onions and set aside in a separate bowl, leaving the melted butter behind in the pan.In a large bowl or pie pan, make the seasoned flower for dredging the chops. Whisk the arrowroot flour, remaining 1 teaspoon sea salt, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, and black pepper together. Place each pork chop in the flower and be sure to coat on all sides. Lay the dusted chops into the hot buttered pan and cook on high for 5 minutes each side. After both sides are cooked, remove the chops from the pan and place them the bottom of a slow cooker.To make the gravy, turn back to the saute pan now with some meat drippings, a little leftover melted butter, and some flower, add the remaining 1/4 cup of butter and stir until melted. Whisk in the remaining seasoned arrowroot flour mixture (it may start to form a paste at this point) and then whisk in the entire can of full-fat coconut milk. Slowly whisk in the entire cup of chicken or beef broth until the gravy has a smooth consistency (this may take a few turns of the whisk).Pour the gravy over the pork chops in the slow cooker, sprinkle the top with half of the caramelized onions, cover, and turn heat to medium. Cook in the slow cooker for 4-6 hours.When they're finished, carefully pull each chop out and place on a plate. Spoon extra gravy over and sprinkle the top with the remaining caramelized onions.",

(1) Leave the skin on, slice it into 3/4-inch slices so that you end up with scalloped rings. Using a spoon, scoop out seeds from the one end. Then using a paring knife cut out the seeds and uneven flesh from rings. If needed, in order to make them all fit in you baking sheet, you may slice the rings in half to form crescents.If you prefer your squash peeled, slice it in half again and slice each indented line so that you have about 1 1/2-inch pieces. Then slice each wedge one more time, ending up with about 3/4-inch slices. Using a vegetable or potato peeler, slice off the skin.Transfer slices to the prepared baking sheet and baste the tops with oil.Sprinkle with garlic powder and Parmesan cheese. Turn over and drizzle again with oil and sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese.Roast on center shelf of oven for about 25 minutes. They will brown on the bottom side. So, check them all about 15 minutes into baking. The ones that have browned to your liking, turn over. If you think they need 5 more minutes, come back then and turn them over. This prevents them from burning. The longer you bake them, the fluffier the meat of the squash becomes. If you bake them 30 minutes, they will be fluffy as mashed/whipped potatoes.",

Coat the chicken in extra-virgin olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill about 12 minutes, turning occasionally, then set aside.                          Bring water in saucepot to a boil for the pasta. Salt the water, add pasta and undercook by 1 minute.                          While the pasta cooks, melt 6 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepot. Spoon out 1/2 and toss with the panko to moisten. Combine with 1/2 the grated Pecorino and reserve. To the remaining melted butter, add the garlic and anchovy paste, lots of coarse black pepper, stir 2 minutes then whisk in flour then stock, milk, and Worcestershire, thicken until it coats a spoon, then stir in the remaining half of the grated Pecorino.                          Drain the pasta. Halve the chicken breasts lengthwise, then thinly slice and combine with the pasta and sauce, transfer to a casserole and top with the bread crumbs. Cool and store for make-ahead meal.                          To reheat: Reheat, covered, in a hot 425 degree F oven to warm through, then uncover to brown.                          Serve with shredded escarole or romaine and dress with lemon juice and extra-virgin olive oil. Serve alongside Chicken Caesar Mac.",

Add the coffee and stir to dissolve. Add the marshmallow crème and beat on low until blended and smooth. Fold in the whipped topping.Line a 9 inch round springform pan with foil and place the first layer of your angel food cake in the pan. You may have to squish it in a bit. Spread about 1/2 of the mocha mousse over the cake. Top with second layer of cake. Add remaining mocha mousse. Top with remaining layer of angel food cake. Put plastic wrap over the cake and put the whole thing in the freeze for about 3 hours or until frozen.As soon as you put the cake in the freezer, go ahead and start preparing the chocolate whipped cream since the chocolate mixture requires some chill time too.Whisk sugar, cocoa powder, milk, coffee powder and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, about 1 hour or up to 4.Set the stand mixer bowl back on the mixer and with the whisk attachment, beat on medium, gradually adding the cream. Continue beating, increasing speed slightly, until stiff peaks begin form — be careful not to overdo it.Remove frozen cake from freezer and unlatch sides of pan. Peel away foil and set frozen cake on a cake tray. Spread chocolate whipped cream over entire cake. You’ll have plenty of chocolate whipped cream and possible even a little left over. Store cake in the refrigerator.",

Using a wooden spoon or electric mixer, blend the eggs and oils to form a smooth emulsion (like mayonnaise), then add the soy milk, vanilla, and sugar. Add the remaining dry ingredients and continue mixing until you have a smooth, thick frangipane batter (if it's dense and dry, add a little more milk to loosen the mixture).                                                                                                                             2                                                                            Grease 6 dessert or pudding molds (about 4 inches in diameter) using a little grape seed oil. Cover the insides of the molds with the quinoa, then tip them upside down to remove any excess.                                                                                                                            3                                                                            Transfer the frangipane to a pastry (piping) bag fitted with a plain tip (nozzle) and fill the molds, dividing the mixture evenly among them. Place 3 plum halves on top of the frangipane, then place the molds on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes or until the plums look a little shriveled and the frangipane is golden and feels firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a serving plate. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.",

Add the onion, carrots and celery and cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 4 minutes. Add the mushrooms, thyme and tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until incorporated, about 3 minutes.                          Stir the flour into the vegetables until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add the broth, Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook until slightly thickened, about 3 more minutes. Stir in the parsley.                          Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Finish the topping: Combine the butter and milk in the reserved pot and cook over medium heat until the butter is melted. Return the potatoes and turnips to the pot and mash with a potato masher or wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the parmesan and chives and season with salt and pepper.                          Transfer the filling to a 2 1/2-quart baking dish and cover with the topping, spreading evenly. Bake until the topping is golden, about 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving.",

In a small heavy saucepan, heat cream and ginger until bubbles form around sides of pan. Remove from heat.                                                                                           Place flour, almonds, confectioners' sugar and cocoa in a food processor; pulse until blended. Add cold butter; pulse until butter is the size of peas. While pulsing, add 1/4 cup amaretto to form moist crumbs. Press onto bottom and up sides of an ungreased 9-in. fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Bake 13-16 minutes or until set. Cool on a wire rack.                                                                                           Place chocolate in a small bowl. Bring gingered cream just to a boil.

            "instructions": "For the pesto: Combine the basil and garlic in a food processor and mix while slowly adding the olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Continue this process until all the basil has been used. Reserve 1/4 cup of the pesto to mix into the rice. Transfer the remaining pesto to a bowl and mix with the shredded cheeses. Cover with plastic wrap and set in refrigerator.                          For the rice: In a medium saucepot over high heat, add the beef stock, butter and salt. When the stock reaches a boil, add the rice and stir it a bit to prevent sticking. Let it come to a rolling boil and lower the heat a bit to medium. Stir the rice once in a while, you want the rice to absorb all of the liquid; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be slightly al dente but creamy. Remove the pot from the heat, add the cheeses and add the 1/4 cup reserved pesto to the rice and stir thoroughly. Pour the rice onto a baking sheet and spread into a thin layer. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool, preferably overnight in the fridge.                          For the filling and assembly: Portion out the cooled rice into identical portions. We weigh ours to 1.6 ounces. Take one portion and form it into a semi-circle in the palm of your hand, making a cup-like shape to place the pesto and cherry tomato. Scoop about 1 tablespoons of the pesto-cheese mixture into the half ball and then 2 tomato halves. Take another portion of rice and flatten it into a disk shape. Place that disk over the half ball to enclose the pesto and tomatoes in the center. Have a bowl of warm water nearby to dip your hands into; it'll make the process easier and less sticky. Roll the ball around to enclose all the ingredients in the center and shape into a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.                          For the batter and breading: Place the flour and 1 1/2 cups cold water into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk until smooth and about the consistency of eggnog. Place the breadcrumbs in a large bowl or baking dish. Roll each ball in batter and shake off excess batter. Then roll each ball in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the balls.                          Use a heavy duty pot with enough canola oil to submerge the balls in. Make sure the oil isn't near the top of the pot because it will overflow when you drop your balls in. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F, using a high temp thermometer if you have one. If not you can throw a small piece of white bread in to test; it should brown quickly and float when the oil is hot enough.                          Use a slotted spoon or wire basket to lower your balls into the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the balls - maybe 2 or 3 at a time. Fry in batches until they are golden like arancini (\"little oranges\"), about 5 minutes. Remove and place on paper towels to drain. Eat hot.",
