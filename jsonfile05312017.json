Transfer to a small bowl, and stir until smooth. Cover and refrigerate about 3 hours (or more) until thick and spreadable. Be sure to stir often during this process it will improve the texture of the ganache. Bring to room temperature before using.Make the dough: In a large bowl whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate large bowl stir together butter, brown sugar, and egg. Add flour mixture to butter mixture, and stir to combine. Knead until a dough forms. Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic wrap; chill in the refrigerator at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.Make the cookies: When ready to form cookies roll out each half of dough between 2 sheets of lightly floured parchment to about 1/8-inch thick. Transfer to baking sheets, and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.Preheat oven to 350 degrees with racks in upper and lower thirds. using a cookie cutter that’s about 2-inches wide (choose an uncomplicated shape such as round, square, heart or star), making sure you have even numbers in each for a total of about twenty-four 2-inch cookies, re-rolling and re-chilling scraps as needed. Place cookies 1 inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets, and freeze until very firm, about 15 minutes.Bake until firm and fragrant, about 10 to 12 minutes, rotating halfway through. Let cookies cool completely on baking sheets set on wire racks. Spread or pipe (using a pastry bag and a small plain tip) the ganache filling onto bottom side of half the cookies, and sandwich with remaining cookies, pressing gently. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.Make the optional topping: Melt the remaining 3 ounces of white chocolate in a small heat proof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Once melted drizzle or pipe (using a pastry bag and a small plain tip) the white chocolate in an attractive pattern over the tops of the cookies.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading...",

Place the orange rinds in the slow cooker as well to add flavor. Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or high for 4-5 hours until pork is tender.When pork is done remove from slow cooker and remove the onions, oranges, garlic and jalapenos, so all you have remaining is liquid.

Immediately remove from heat and stir in the mint leaves. Cover and let stand for 1 hour to allow the flavours to infuse.Pour the infused cream through a fine mesh strainer to remove the mint, pressing firmly on the leaves to extract as much flavour as possible.Stir in the sugar and salt, and return the infused cream to the stovetop over medium-high heat. Warm the cream until wisps of steam start to rise from the surface.In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, then slowly pour some of the warm mint mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan.Cook the custard, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Immediately remove from heat, and stir in the remaining 1 cup cream along with the creme de menthe and food colouring, if using.Scrape the custard into a clean mixing bowl, and cover with plastic wrap, placing the wrap directly on the surface of the custard to stop a skin from forming. Chill thoroughly in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.While the custard base is chilling, melt the chocolate in the microwave or a double boiler until smooth. Add the oil, and set aside to cool to room temperature.Using an ice cream maker, freeze the chilled custard as per the manufacturer’s directions.To create the chocolate “chips”, spoon a layer of ice cream into the container, then drizzle a thin stream of chocolate overtop using a swirling motion. Continue alternating layers of ice cream and chocolate until both of them are done, then swirl the mixture with a butter knife to break up the chocolate into irregular pieces. Cover and transfer to the freezer to chill until firm and scoopable, about 3-4 hours.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, combine the oil, egg, half-and-half, lemon juice and zest, the 1 cup (8 ounces) sugar, and the almond extract. Whisk to blend thoroughly. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until just combined.3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Arrange the plum halves, cut side up, on top of the batter. In a bowl, combine the almonds, the 2 tablespoons sugar, and the butter and mix well. Dot the almond topping over the cake.4. Bake the cake until the topping is golden brown and a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. (If using an 8-inch pan, you may need to bake it longer, being careful to cover the outer edges of the cake with a strip of foil if they begin to brown.) Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 20 minutes. Remove the ring from the pan and place the cake on a serving platter. Cut into wedges and serve warm or, if you can wait, at room temperature.",

Stir and cook until tender, 10-15 minutes.While apples are cooking, in a small bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar, flour and vanilla. Set aside.Pop open crescent roll dough and unroll, leaving crescents in rectangles. On an ungreased baking sheet, lay the crescent roll rectangles together, lining them up width wise. Dough should be almost the entire length of a half sheet pan.Press edges together to even out edges and seal any holes. Cut 1/2 inch diagonal strips up each side of the dough. Carefully spread cream cheese filling down the center of the dough to be about 2-3 inches wide. Top with cooked apples.Fold 1/2 inch dough pieces up over filling alternating sides to get a braided pattern. You may have excess dough once you reach the end of the danish, so fold them in as best as you can. Bake for 20 minutes or until filling is set and crescent dough is golden in color. Cool at least 20 minutes before removing from baking sheet.Once danish has cooled, remove to serving platter. In a small bowl, mix together powdered sugar, vanilla and cream to create icing. You may need to add more cream to get the desired consistency. Drizzle icing over danish.Cut into pieces and serve.",

Cook the bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels, then chop. Add the bell pepper and all but 1 tablespoon of the scallions to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 4 minutes. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper and cook until wilted, 5 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl; reserve the skillet.                          Split the potatoes and scoop out half of the flesh from each; stir into the vegetables along with the cheese, broth, hot sauce and all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon. Season with salt and pepper.

            "instructions": "Make the sponge cake crust1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.2. In a small bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.3. Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until thick, light yellow ribbons form, about 5 minutes more. Beat in the extracts.4. Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand, just until no more white flecks appear. Now, blend in the melted butter.5. Now, wash the mixing bowl and beaters really well (if even a little fat is left, this can cause the egg whites not to whip). Put the egg whites and cream of tartar into the bowl and beat with the mixer on high until frothy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form (the whites will stand up and look glossy, not dry). Fold about one-third of the whites into the batter, then the remaining whites. Don’t worry if you still see a few white specks, as they’ll disappear during baking.6. Gently spread out the batter over the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it’s done. Watch carefully and don’t let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the cheesecake batter.Make the cheesecake7. Dissolve the instant espresso in the hot water in a small cup and let stand. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl down several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each one. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar, then the vanilla.8. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each one. Stir the dissolved coffee into the cream, then beat into the cream cheese mixture just until completely blended. Be careful not to overmix! Gently spoon the batter on top of the cooled sponge cake crust.9. Place the cake in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the springform. Bake until the edges are light golden brown and the top is light tan, about 1 1/4 hours. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and let the cake cool for 2 hours (just walk away — don’t move it). Leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely cold, preferably overnight or at least 4 hours.10. To decorate, release and remove the sides of the springform, leaving the cake on the bottom of the pan. Place on a cake plate. Cover the top with chocolate curls and dust with cocoa. Decorate the center of the cake with a few coffee beans if you wish (be sure to remove them before serving). Refrigerate until ready to serve. Slice the cold cake with a sharp straight-edge knife, not a serrated one. Cover any leftover cake and refrigerate, or wrap and freeze for up to one month.",

Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides.2. In a small bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.3. Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until thick, light yellow ribbons form, about 5 minutes more. Beat in the extracts.4. Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand, just until no more white flecks appear. Now, blend in the melted butter.5. Now, wash the mixing bowl and beaters really well (if even a little fat is left, this can cause the egg whites not to whip).",

Gently spread out the batter over the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it’s done. Watch carefully and don’t let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the cheesecake batter.Make the cheesecake7. Dissolve the instant espresso in the hot water in a small cup and let stand. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1/3 cup of the sugar, and the cornstarch in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping the bowl down several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each one. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 1 1/3 cups sugar, then the vanilla.8.

You may have to use your fingers to press it all together.Divide the dough in half and press it across the bottom and halfway up the sides of the 2 mini cheesecake pans. Gently prick the dough across the bottom of the pan with a fork several times. Bake for only 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.Reduce the oven temperature to 350.In a large bowl beat the cream cheese and sugar until fluffy and smooth.Add the egg and beat for about 1½ minutes. Add the vanilla, cream, and bourbon. Beat until combined. Divide the batter evenly between the two par-baked crusts.Bake at 350 for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 275 (I like to open the oven door for just a minute to help the temperature drop) and bake for 15 more minutes. Turn the oven off and let the cheesecakes cool IN the oven.When they have cooled to room temperature, remove and refrigerate. (Sometimes I am in a hurry so I take mine out when it is cool enough to grab by hand -- the pans will still feel warm) The cheesecakes will need to chill for at least an hour (from room temperature).While the cheesecakes chill, and just before you are ready to serve,heat the hot fudge in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When it is smooth and warm (a pourable consistency), stir in the bourbon. Drizzle the chocolate over each cheesecake and serve.",

Salt the water and cook the pasta shy of al dente, 5 to 6 minutes.                          While the water comes to a boil, heat the EVOO in a Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add the bacon and crisp. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon and remove some of the drippings, leaving a thin layer. Add the beef, brown and crumble, but leave a few larger pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Once the beef has caramelized, add the onions and cook to tender. Add the stock and Worcestershire, then reduce the heat to low.                          In a saucepot over medium to medium-high heat, melt the butter. Whisk in the flour, cook 1 minute. Whisk in the milk and season with salt and pepper. Thicken to coat the back of a spoon. Stir in the cheese. When the cheese has melted into the sauce, stir in the mustard, ketchup, relish and hot sauce. Combine the pasta with the sauce and fold in the meat. Place in a large casserole dish. Cool and store for a make-ahead meal.                          To serve, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bring the casserole to room temp then bake until brown and bubbly on top and golden at edges, 45 to 50 minutes.",

Pour the liquid yogurt panna cotta into 4 - 6 oz. ramekins or short wide mugs.Cover and refrigerate for at least two hours.Once the panna cotta sets, combine the blackberries, water, 3/4 tsp. gelatin, maple syrup, pinch of salt and orange zest in a small sauce pan. Bring to a boil, lower the temperature, and simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken.Allow the blackberry gel to cool for 10 minutes. Then spoons evenly over the tops of the yogurt panna cotta cups.Return to the fridge and chill another two hours minimum.Serve as is, or remove from molds.To remove the panna cotta from the molds: Run a sharp knife around the rim of each cup. Fill a small bowl with hot water. Then hold each cup in the water for approximately 30 seconds. Place a dessert plate over the top and flip. You may have to wait a few moments for the panna cotta to release, plopping gently on the plate. Repeat with the rest.",

Remove garlic and shallots and set aside.4. Raise heat to high and add the steaks, making sure they are at least once inch apart.  Cook them without moving them for 4 minutes.  Turn them with tongs and cook another 4 minutes.  (This will cook them medium rare - adjust the cooking time if you like them more well done, or if your steaks are thicker than 2 inches).5. Remove the steaks, spread them with herb butter and let them sit for 5 minutes.  Then serve with the browned garlic and shallots scattered around them.",
